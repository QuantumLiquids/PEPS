Build should perform in `build` directory. 
If make file and you need run cmake, Please follow the following pattern:

cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang++  
-DGTest_DIR:PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib/cmake/GTest
and other options

If meet error like when run `cmake`:

CMake Error at /opt/homebrew/share/cmake/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:233 (message):
  Could NOT find OpenMP_CXX (missing: OpenMP_CXX_FLAGS OpenMP_CXX_LIB_NAMES)

rerun exactly same command `cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin/clang++ -DGTest_DIR:PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib/cmake/GTest -DOtherOptions`  once again.
